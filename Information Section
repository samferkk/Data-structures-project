Project projection: Boojam has been sent out on a last minute run to get Christmas. Its now a mad dash through the mall to get
everything time.


Introduction: The premis of this game was to have a scavenger hunt for the user to play. The user will be require to navigate thorugh a
mall to collect item that are required by the christmas list. Thing is the user is only able to know one item at a time and the location 
of the item is not given. Another fun twist is that there is not map of the mall and the user is blind to the stores until they explore
them. SO the trick to this game is to explore the mall and figure out what stores exist and which items they have and then return to
them as items are revealed form the list.
